## About Server Slayer (User Story)

- Server Slayer is a simple game based on the popularity of the "Among Us" game. An application developed using Socket.io, MongoDB, REST API, Basic Auth, and Bearer Auth. Users will have the ability to create a username, authenticate username, and authorize token to be able to join the game. The agenda of the game is for the players to identify the imposter that's slaying or killing the players, and the players' agenda is the find out who the imposter that's wiping them out one by one. If the Killer successfully slays or kills all the players, the killer wins. If the players successfully identifies the killer via voting process, the players win. Players only have 2 opportunites or 2 rounds to vote and identify the killer. Voting will only commence once a player has been killed. Server will then broadcast to all the players that a player died and they need to identify and vote who among the remaining players is the imposter that's killing them.
